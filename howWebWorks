1. The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol governs the process by which clients retrieve data from or send data to a server.

2. Abbreviated as URL, a Uniform Resource Locator serves as an address for accessing various resources on the internet.

3. DNS, or Domain Name System, translates human-readable URLs into corresponding IP addresses.

4. The query string in a URL facilitates passing key-value pairs, formatted as `?key1=value1&key2=value2...`.

5. 
    - GET method: Retrieves data from the server, commonly used for accessing web pages and search forms.
    - POST method: Sends data to the server, typically employed for operations that modify server-side data.

6. An HTTP request refers to a client's communication to a server following the HTTP protocol, such as requesting HTML content from a site like news.google.com.

7. An HTTP response denotes the server's reply to a client following the HTTP protocol, often containing HTML/CSS/JS resources.

8. Headers convey additional information regarding the request or response. Examples include:
    - Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
    - Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

9. 
    1. Your browser resolves the URL into an IP address using DNS.
    2. The browser sends a request to that IP address, including relevant headers containing information about the browser and any stored cookies.
    3. The server responds, typically with HTML and a status code indicating success (e.g., 200).
    4. The browser constructs a Document Object Model (DOM) from the received HTML and retrieves any additional resources required (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript).
    5. Separate HTTP requests are made by the browser for each of these resources, with responses received from the server accordingly.
